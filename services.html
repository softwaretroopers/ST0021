                The robotic design creates a plan or convention for building a
                robot or a robotic system (architectural design, engineering
                drawing, operational process, circuit diagrams). The design has
                different meanings in various fields. Sometimes the direct
                construction of an object (pottery, engineering, management,
                graphic design, etc.) is considered design. More formally
                defined robot design; demonstrated by a robot designer, in a
                specific robotic environment, using a set of primary components
                intended to achieve goals, satisfying a set of needs, subject to
                limitations; to create a robot design in a robot environment.
                Robotics technology affects every aspect of work and home.
                Robotics also can positively transform lives and routines,
                increase efficiency and security levels, and enhance service
                levels. Robotics development is basing on two related
                technologies: numerical control and telephone operators.
                Numerical control is a method of controlling machine tool axes
                by numbers encoded on perforated paper strips or other media.
                The first numerical control machine tool demonstrates in 1952 at
                the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Subsequent
                research at MIT led to developing the APT (Automatically
                Programmed Tools) language for programming machine tools.
                Robotics is increasingly being applied to small manufacturing
                industries central to production and employment capacity in
                Europe. Similarly, service robotics will have more disruptive
                effects than the competition in non-manufacturing industries
                such as agriculture, transportation, healthcare, security, and
                utilities. From a relatively low base today, service robots used
                in non-manufacturing areas are expected to become the largest
                global robot sales area.

                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the basis for simulating human
                intelligence processes by designing and applying algorithms
                built into a dynamic computer environment. Simply put, AI seeks
                to think and act like computer humans. Since the first century,
                humans have been fascinated by machines that mimic the human
                brain. In the modern world, the term artificial intelligence was
                coined in 1955 by John McCarthy. This start-up led to machine
                learning, in-depth learning, forecast analysis, and now recipe
                analysis. It was giving rise to a new field of study, data
                science. Today, the amount of data generated by humans and
                machines is far more significant than humans' ability to absorb,
                interpret, and make various complex decisions based on that
                data. Artificial intelligence is the basis of all computer
                learning and the future of all complex decision-making.
                Computers are incredibly efficient at calculating these
                combinations and impulses to make the best decision. AI and
                in-depth knowledge are the fundamental future of business
                decision-making. Applications of AI can find in everyday
                situations such as financial service fraud detection, retail
                purchase forecasting, and online customer support interaction.
                The financial services industry also uses artificial
                intelligence in two ways. Marking loan applications first uses
                AI to understand credit eligibility. Advanced AI engines are
                using to track and detect fraudulent payment card transactions
                in real-time. Mainly, call centers use VCA to predict and
                respond to customer inquiries outside of human interaction. The
                first and foremost point of interaction in a customer service
                query is voice recognition and integrated human conversation.

                Hardware and software cannot consider independent when planning
                to develop modern embedded systems. Also, the last twenty years
                have seen tremendous growth in chip and system sophistication.
                More and more system functionality is shifting from dedicated
                hardware implementation to software running on general-purpose
                embedded processors. Software development efforts have surpassed
                hardware development efforts, and the complex trend continues to
                be software. Traditional design techniques such as standalone
                hardware and software design are challenging by integrating
                heterogeneous models and applications to create a complex system
                on chips. Using the proper hardware-software coding techniques,
                the developers demonstrate how the system's hardware and
                software components work together. Creating a template for your
                embedded system provides a cost-effective and time-consuming
                approach to developing simple or incredibly complex dynamic
                control systems, all based on a single model running within a
                tightly integrated software suite. You can design and perform
                basic validation in offline simulation using modern modeling
                software tools. These models then provide the basis for all
                subsequent developmental stages. Modeling for your embedded
                design offers many advantages over the traditional design
                approach. Using this approach - in conjunction with hardware
                prototyping - reduces your risk of errors and shortens the
                development cycle by performing verification and validation
                tests not only during the final testing phase but throughout
                development.

                The Internet of Things (IoT) solutions has proven to be
                beneficial to almost every industry, facilitating the creation
                of new businesses and enhancing efficiency. IoT solutions help
                connect devices, manage tasks, analyze opportunities, and
                transfer information securely. They offer a safe and secure
                environment in which to operate and help businesses achieve
                growth. IoT system could be a person with a heart monitor, a
                farm animal with a bio-chip transponder, a car built with
                sensors to alert the driver when the tire pressure is low, or
                some other natural or human-made. An Internet Protocol (IP)
                object that can assign an address and transfer data over a
                network. An IoT ecosystem consists of web-enabled smart devices
                that use embedded systems such as processors, sensors, and
                communication hardware. IoT devices share the sensor data they
                collect by connecting to an IoT portal or other edge device that
                sends data to the cloud for local analysis or analysis.
                Sometimes, these devices communicate with other related devices
                and act on information received from each other. Devices perform
                many functions without human intervention, although humans can
                interact with devices - for example, to set them up, advise
                them, or access data. The connectivity, networking, and
                communication protocols used with these web-enabled devices
                depend primarily on the specific IoT applications deployed. IoT
                can use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to
                make data collection processes more accessible and dynamic.

              <p>
                Mainly, the concept of big data has been around for years; Many
                companies now realize that if they can capture all the data
                flowing into their business, they can apply analytics and gain
                significant value from it. Even in the 1950s, decades before the
                word "big data" was coined, basic analytics (essentially
                manually checking spreadsheet numbers) uncovered business
                insights and trends. The new benefits brought to the big data
                analysis desk, however, are speed and efficiency. A few years
                ago, a business might have gathered information, executed
                analytics, and found information that can be used for future
                options. Today, a business can identify with understanding quick
                decisions. The ability to work fast - and to be diligent - gives
                organizations an unprecedented competitive edge. Big data
                analytics allows organizations to use their data and identify
                new opportunities. It leads to better business operations, more
                efficient operations, higher profits, and more satisfied
                customers. In his report on Big Data in Big Companies, IIA
                Research Director Tom Davenport interviewed more than 50
                businesses and learned how they used big data. Large data
                technologies have significant cost advantages over storing large
                amounts of data - and they can identify more efficient methods
                of doing business. With the speed of analytics and memory
                analysis, and the ability to analyze new data sources,
                businesses can analyze information instantly and make decisions
                based on what they have learned. Analysis empowers customers to
                provide what they need with the ability to measure customer
                needs and satisfaction.

                "Electronic Manufacturing Services" (EMS) refers to an entire
                industry as well as a specific subcontractor or company. EMS is
                often exchanging with the more common term "Contract Product."
                Electronic Manufacturing Services companies provide a wide range
                of value-added engineering and product outsourcing services to
                Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), thereby improving
                operational efficiency and focusing on core activities such as
                research and development (R&D). The electronic manufacturing
                services (EMS) market is dynamic, and the demand for electronics
                and peripherals products is increasing. According to market
                research, the industry is forecast to grow at an annual rate of
                7.5% between 2018 and 2024. Increasing demand for consumer
                electronics and innovative technological advances allows
                manufacturers to take advantage of current opportunities. ECM
                has enabled companies to shed all or most of their in-house
                manufacturing facilities, freeing up their valuable corporate
                resources for other business-friendly business purposes. In some
                cases, electronic contract products have enabled companies to
                operate without the need for in-house production capabilities or
                internally managed factories. Many companies may select to
                outsource their well-established long-term products to an
                electronic contract manufacturer, which allows them to focus
                more on internal operations for new complex products with higher
                margins. With increasing customer demand and the need to control
                costs, manufacturers may want to partner with solutions
                providers that offer industry specificity and experience. As a
                global leader in high mixed low volume production, we first see
                the critical role we play in evolving the EMS industry and the
                electronic value chain.

                Today, everything is customer-satisfied. Technological advances
                throughout the industry aim at enriching the customer experience
                and improving the user satisfaction rate. In the current market
                dynamics, customer satisfaction depends on three main factors -
                the speed of delivery, cost-effectiveness, productivity, and,
                most importantly, quality. If a product/service can add value to
                customers, their satisfaction levels will increase
                proportionately. The global market for software testing services
                expects to grow by the US $ 29.84 billion in 2019-2023,
                surpassing CAGR by 12%. Software companies also try to break
                away from the legacy processes and methods and the old-school
                approach to software development. Where QA is positioning on a
                priority scale, companies need time to build quality offers, and
                they do not have extra time due to intense market competition.
                Automation becomes the key to aligning both qualities as well as
                delivery speed. As a counter test, the testing automation
                services market is growing exponentially through software
                testing services. Software testing automation is one of the
                prominent reasons for the rising market share. However,
                automation or quality is not cheap. Hosting a testing
                environment, maintaining test equipment and testing
                opportunities, and developing infrastructure are troublesome and
                costly. Thus, Independent software testing services prove to be
                a blessing in disguise. Partnering with an external QA vendor
                for independent software testing services allows you to take
                advantage of a dedicated testing team without the challenge of
                maintaining such a team.
